        <h2>BLRS2 SIGBots - Tipping Point</h2>
        <p>
          Tipping Point was the 2021-2022 VEX Robotics game where I competed on team BLRS2 as my second year on the Purdue SIGBots team.
          This year was much more exciting as we were able to compete more often compared to last year, and the World Championship event
          was in-person this year. Throughout the season, both SIGBots teams, BLRS & BLRS2, went to 4 competitions including the World
          Championship. The first 3 competitions were at Monroe County Community College, Auburn University, and our home competition at
          Purdue University. At all three competition, the two Purdue teams were against each other in finals with a Purdue team taking
          a win every time. At the World Championship, my team, BLRS2, was the <b>2022 World Skills Champion</b> where we outscored 73 other teams
          from universities around the world.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          The objectives for the Tipping Point were to obtain mobile goals, pick up and score rings on branches on the mobile goals, and
          either place the mobile goals on a tipping platform, or park your robot or robots while holding the mobile goals. The game is
          split up into a 45 second autonomous period followed by 1 minute and 15 seconds of driver period where a team of 2 robots go
          head to head against another team. One of the major challenges of this game was getting to the mobile goals in the middle of
          the field before your opponents, and preventing them from grabbing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kSVlATxMqhQ" target="_blank">
          My solution</a> to this worked very well and we never lost the goal rush at the World Championship event.

        <h2>BLRS SIGBots - Change Up</h2>
        <p>
          Change Up was the 2020-2021 VEX Robotics season, and my first year on the Purdue SIGBots team. Although many competitions were
          canceled because of Covid, we were still able to compete in two tournaments this season. Our first tournament was hosted by
          Auburn University which we ended up winning. Our second competition was in place of the World Championship and was hosted at
          VEX headquarters in Greenville Texas. We ended up as finalists, losing in the final match but won <b>Skills Champion and the
          Think Award</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up balls from the ground and score them in the nine goals located around the
          field as well as descore the opposing team's color from these goals. Bonus points are awarded to teams who can create rows, columns,
          or diagonals with their color. This game was much simpler than most games so the real challenge was scoring as efficiently as
          possible. One way this differed from my previous experience is that with the VEXU competition, teams are allowed to manufacture
          custom parts. This allowed us to use laser-cut metals and 3D-printed parts on our robots.

        <h2>7701T Tesseract - Tower Takeover</h2>
        <p>
          Tower Takeover was the 2019-2020 VEX Robotics season. My team again qualified for both the Indiana State Championship and the
          VEX World Championship. We ended the season 29th in the world for individual skills out of around 10,000 international teams.
          Unfortunately, the 2020 VEX World Championship was canceled due to Covid-19 so we were unable to compete. This season we earned
          a total of 11 awards: Tournament Champion (x5), Tournament Finalist, Excellence Award (x2), Robot Skills Champion (x2), and
          the Judges Award. This was by far my most successful season, <b>winning almost half of the competitions we went to</b>.

          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up cubes and stack them in specified areas as well as score the cubes in
          towers located around the field. We were able to create a robot that completed all of these tasks efficiently, scoring more
          points much faster than most if not all of the other teams.

        <h2>7701T Tesseract - Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
          Turning Point was the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics season. My team, 7701T Tesseract, qualified for both the Indiana State Championship
          and the VEX World Championship. We placed 18th in the world for individual skills out of around 10,000 international teams.
          At the 2019 World Championship, we made it to the elimination matches where we finished as division semi-finalists. We earned
          a total of 3 awards this year: <b>Excellence Award, Judges Award, and the Amaze Award</b>.

          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up and shoot balls at plastic flags to toggle them to your color, to pick up,
          flip, and place caps onto raised poles, and climb a platform at the end of the match. We used the engineering process to create
          the robot to effectively and efficiently complete all of these tasks.

        <h2 id="mkb">Custom Mechanical Keyboard</h2>
        <p>
          This is a 3D printed, hand-wired, custom mechanical keyboard. I have always been interested in mechanical keyboards ever since
          I got my first desktop PC. The satisfying feedback you receive when pressing the keys makes typing on them enjoyable. I wanted
          to take this experience even further by creating a custom layout. Many of the mainstream methods to custom mechanical keyboards
          are either limiting in their customization or very expensive so I thought I could take up this challenge to make a relatively
          inexpensive custom mechanical keyboard.
        </p>
        <div id="images">
          <img class="center" src="images/kb1.jpg" alt="Keyboard 1">
          <img class="center" src="images/kb3.jpg" alt="Keyboard 2">
        </div>
        <p>
          The first step to create this was to figure out the layout of the keys. I wanted something more compact that would take up less
          space on my desk, but still have all the functionality, if not more, of standard keyboards. I used a very handy tool called
          <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">keyboard-layout-editor</a> that made planning much easier. I decided to cut off
          the F1-F12 keys as they could easily be mapped to another layer, and add a column of macro keys to the left side that could be
          programmed to anything I might need. I then CADed the layout to create the plate for the switches as well as the case
          everything would sit in. I then 3D printed these, having to split them up into two separate parts because of the limitations
          of the bed size on the 3D printer. After a few prototypes, I was able to find a nice profile to hold the switches in nice and snug.
          Since I had a custom layout, a PCB with the layout doesn't exist and would be fairly pricy to have made
          by a company so the remaining option was to hand-wire everything together. With 70 switches and 3 solders per switch, I had to
          solder over 210 times, not including the wiring of the columns and rows to the microcontroller. After I finished soldering everything
          together and finishing up the board, I was very surprised that not one solder joint was faulty and the keyboard was working
          completely fine. Hey, I'm even typing this website on the keyboard right now. The macro keys on the side are some of the most useful
          keys I use and don't think I could ever go back to a normal keyboard. I highly recommend this project if you are interested in
          mechanical keyboards.

        <h2 id="pong">2.5D Pong</h2>
        <p>
          This is a simple pong game with a twist. It adds some aspects of the third dimension and physics to make the game more interesting
          than traditional pong. This was originally created for a final project in my engineering class but I decided to continue the
          project to where it is today. Future features might include the option for an online multi-player so users can play with others
          more easily. Feel free to try it out here: <a href="https://github.com/dholifield/2.5DPong" target="_blank">2.5D Pong</a>. More
          information on the project can be found in my <a href="2.5D Pong Report.pdf" target="_blank">report.</a>

        <h2 id="rcp">Radio Controlled Planes</h2>
        <p>
          These are some of the model planes I have made using plans from <a href="https://store.flitetest.com/" target="_blank">FliteTest</a>. These were
          really fun to build going from plain sheets of foamboard and sketches to cutting and assembling with hot glue to their final
          form as a plane. Although the planes haven't had much airtime, they were fun to build and it's amazing to see something
          I made from minimal materials turn into something as beautiful as these planes.
