        <h2>7701T Tesseract - Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
          Turning Point was the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics season. My team, 7701T Tesseract, qualified for both the Indiana State Championship
          and the VEX World Championship. We placed 18th in the world for individual skills out of around 10,000 international teams.
          At the 2019 World Championship we ranked decently in qualifications and made it to the elimination matches where we finished
          as division semi-finalists.

          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up and shoot balls at plastic flags to toggle them to your color, to pick up,
          flip, and place caps onto raised poles, and climb a platform at the end of the match. We used the engineering process to create
          the robot to effectively and efficiently complete all of these tasks.
