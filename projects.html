        <h2>7701T Tesseract - Turning Point</h2>
        <p>
          Turning Point was the 2018-2019 VEX Robotics season. My team, 7701T Tesseract, qualified for both the Indiana State Championship
          and the VEX World Championship. We placed 18th in the world for individual skills out of around 10,000 international teams.
          At the 2019 World Championship, we made it to the elimination matches where we finished as division semi-finalists. We earned
          a total of 3 awards this year: Excellence Award, Judges Award, and the Amaze Award.
        </p>

        <p>
          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up and shoot balls at plastic flags to toggle them to your color, to pick up,
          flip, and place caps onto raised poles, and climb a platform at the end of the match. We used the engineering process to create
          the robot to effectively and efficiently complete all of these tasks.

        <h2>7701T Tesseract - Tower Takeover</h2>
        <p>
          Tower Takeover was the 2019-2020 VEX Robotics season. My team again qualified for both the Indiana State Championship and the
          VEX World Championship. We ended the season 29th in the world for individual skills out of around 10,000 international teams.
          Unfortunately, the 2020 VEX World Championship was canceled due to Covid-19 so we were unable to compete. This season we earned
          a total of 11 awards: Tournament Champion (x5), Tournament Finalist, Excellence Award (x2), Robot Skills Champion (x2), and
          the Judges Award. This was by far my most successful season, winning almost half of the competitions we went to.

          The objectives of the game this year were to pick up cubes and stack them in specified areas as well as score the cubes in
          towers located around the field. We were able to create a robot that completed all of these tasks efficiently, scoring more
          points much faster than most if not all of the other teams.
